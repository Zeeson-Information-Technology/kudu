  title: "Our Story",
  content:
    "Kudu Health was founded to address the fundamental challenge of digital health in Nigeria's primary care facilities: how to deliver reliable healthcare when internet connectivity cannot be guaranteed. Drawing from extensive experience working with Nigerian health systems, our team recognized that many digital tools fail at the critical moment—during network outages—leaving clinicians without essential patient information and forcing a return to paper records. We built Kudu Health as an offline-first platform that prioritizes continuity of care while remaining fully aligned with Nigeria's National Digital Health Architecture (NDHA) and National Enterprise Architecture frameworks."

export const aboutProblem = {
  title: "The Challenge",
  description:
    "Primary health centers across Nigeria operate in environments where internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable. Traditional digital health tools often fail during outages, disrupting patient care and forcing clinicians to maintain parallel paper records. This creates inefficiencies, increases the risk of data loss, and undermines the trust and accountability that digital systems are meant to provide. At the same time, national health information systems require standardized, interoperable data that local facilities struggle to consistently provide.",

    "Over 70% of Nigerian health facilities experience regular connectivity issues",
